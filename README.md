Tactical Overview
Real Madrid: Should take the early lead; expect to use 4-2-4 to overload Arsenal’s wings. While Mbappé and Vinícius will hunt for counterattacks, Valverde and Modric will look to settle things in the midfield. It is all about high pressing and set pieces.
Arsenal: Will probably sit in, take it and send Saka and Martinelli. Rice and Partey will shield the defence, and dead balls remain a potent weapon.

Match Odds: Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1, Arsenal 7/2.

Shortly: Arsenal take home a sizeable, three-nil aggregate advantage into the second leg in the Bernabéu. Real Madrid, deprived of many of its best players, must mount a historic turnaround to reach the semifinals.
