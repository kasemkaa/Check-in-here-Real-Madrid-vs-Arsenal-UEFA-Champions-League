Tactical Overview
Real Madrid: Should take the early lead; expect to use 4-2-4 to overload Arsenal’s wings. While Mbappé and Vinícius will hunt for counterattacks, Valverde and Modric will look to settle things in the midfield. It is all about high pressing and set pieces.
Arsenal: Will probably sit in, take it and send Saka and Martinelli. Rice and Partey will shield the defence, and dead balls remain a potent weapon.

Odds & Predictions
To Qualify: Arsenal 1/7, Real Madrid 6/1
Match Odds: Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1, Arsenal 7/2.
THE Expert’s View: Arsenal are likely to go through, but there is something about Real Madrid’s traditions of last-gasp drama at the Bernabéu that guarantees the tie isn’t done until the game is complete.
Shortly: Arsenal take home a sizeable, three-nil aggregate advantage into the second leg in the Bernabéu. Real Madrid, deprived of many of its best players, must mount a historic turnaround to reach the semifinals. Well, unbeaten, unbreached by Madrid in Europe, Arsenal is one step away from a much less familiar territory — a Champions League semifinal
